This repository contains the solution codes of the Smart Interviews Basic hackerrank page.
The solutions provided are not exactly the most optimised versions because those were solved during the very initial phase of learning coding.

Find the problems here : https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/smart-interviews-basic/challenges
## Key Takeaways

The problems are solved primarily in C and Python, although the solutions for some good questions are also provided in Java.
While solving my emphasis was on logic building and not the type of programming language but I would strongly urge everyone out there to learn and solve the problems in Java/C++ as in further stages of learning DSA one amongst these two will come very handy in advanced implementations.



KEEP CODING!! :)
